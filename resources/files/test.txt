Most errors aren’t serious enough to require the program to stop entirely. 
Sometimes, when a function fails, it’s for a reason that you can easily interpret and respond to. 
For example, if you try to open a file and that operation fails because the file doesn’t exist, 
you might want to create the file instead of terminating the process.

The T and E are generic type parameters: we’ll discuss generics in more detail in Chapter 10. 
What you need to know right now is that T represents the type of the value that will be returned in a success case 
within the Ok variant, and E represents the type of the error that will be returned in a failure case within the Err variant. 
Because Result has these generic type parameters, we can use the Result type and the functions defined on it in many different 
situations where the successful value and error value we want to return may differ.
